# Recycling Collection Service
Capstone Project for Data Analytics for Business at St. Clair College

One of the main challenges that we face when we arrive in Canada as international students is finding a job, recycling is one of the ways that we can earn some extra money without uploading hundreds of  resumes or hacking a personal interview, and the best part is we are doing great work for our new city and our planet. 

Currently, the city of Windsor's Open Data Catalogue records nearly 5,000 service requests for uncollected recycling in 2022. Assuming an average of [5 glass bottles (10¢), and 15 cans (TBS/LCBO) (10¢)](https://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership/bag-it-back-odrp/), a basic profit of $10,000 can be generated.

However, monetary gain is not the sole focus. The [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-reducing-waste/reduce-plastic-waste.html) emphasizes the importance of recycling: 

"Canadians throw away over 3 million tonnes of plastic waste every year. Only 9% is recycled while the rest ends up in our landfills"

This project aims to enhance the circular life of recycled materials in Windsor by engaging St. Clair students in the process. 

A key project outcome entails the development of a mobile application that showcases current recycling collection requests in the area. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can optimize collection routes to maximize the number of recyclable materials collected, resulting in greater financial returns for participants and considering factors such as waste weight and type (e.g., glass bottles, cans, etc.). 

In essence, this initiative operates similarly to business models such as Uber or Lyft, but instead of connecting riders with drivers, we connect recyclable object collectors with multiple recycling service requests.
